Steps to create a VENV that is compaible with models that are already in SPROUT

1: create an empty venv
2: copy the 'package_list.txt' file in the root folder of your venv
3: navigate to the folder of your venv that contains the 'pip' executable (usually venv/scripts)
4 run the command
 [windows] pip.exe install -r <path to package_list.txt>
 [linux] pip install -r <path to package_list.txt>
	replacing <path to package_list.txt> with the path where the TXT file is located

Now you have a venv that you can use with SPROUT
